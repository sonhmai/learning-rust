# Learning Rust
Collection of Resources for Leaning Rust Programming Language

## Learning Path
- Skim through or read some chapters the basic books that you are interesting 
- Do the projects or courses, reference the books and the internet when necessary

## Books
### Basics to Intermediate
- [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
    - covers all the language basics
    - includes some projects for practice

- [Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25550614-programming-rust)
    - detailed, comprehensive, description cover of Rust
    - more verbose than `The Rust Programming Language`, personally I perfer this over the other.

- [Zero To Production In Rust](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55730109-zero-to-production-in-rust)
    - an opinionated book for backend development with Rust.
    - if you need to know one idiomatic way to do backend development in Rust at the beginning of the learning journey without being disturbed by too many ways to do one thing then this book is properly for you.

### Intermediate to Advanced
- [Rust for Rustaceans](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58244064-rust-for-rustaceans)
    - intermediate to advanced, after mastering the basics

## Projects
- [Building a Command Line Program](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html)
- [Building a Multithreaded Web Server](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html)
- [Mini-Redis, demo of building with Tokio, Rust most popular async runtime](https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/setup#mini-redis)
- Blockchain: head to BLOCKCHAIN.md

## Courses
- [Practical Networked Applications in Rust.](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan/tree/master/courses/rust) A series of projects that incrementally develop a single Rust project from the ground up into a high-performance, networked, parallel and asynchronous key/value store. Along the way various real-world and practical Rust development subject matter are explored and discussed.

- [Distributed Systems in Rust.](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan/tree/master/courses/dss/) Adapted from the MIT 6.824 distributed systems coursework, this course focuses on implementing important distributed algorithms, including the Raft consensus algorithm, and the Percolator distributed transaction protocol.
